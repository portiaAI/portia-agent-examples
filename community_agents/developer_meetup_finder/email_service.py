                Analyze the context and send an appropriate email to the recipient:

                CONTEXT ANALYSIS:
                - Recipient: recipient_name
                - Interests: recipient_interest
                - Location: recipient_location
                - Number of events: no_of_events
                - Has form URL: Check if {Input('events')} has a form_url key in it

                EVENTS DATA:
                {Input('events')}

                EMAIL STRATEGY (choose based on context):

                1. IF {Input('events')} has registration_status and registration_notes in them
                - Subject: "recipient_interest events in recipient_location with registration updates"
                - Focus: Event showcase + details about automatic registrations attempt
                - Include Event URL
                - Include registration status for each event

                2. IF {Input('events')} has a form_url key:
                - Subject: "num_events curated recipient_interest events in recipient_location - Interest form included"
                - Focus: Event showcase + form for preferences
                - Include Event URL
                - Include registration preference form

                EMAIL STRUCTURE (adapt based on strategy above):

                1. GREETING: Hi recipient_name,

                2. INTRODUCTION (2-3 sentences based on mode):
                - Reference interests and location
                - Summary of the events and registration details

                3. EVENTS SHOWCASE:
                Use <ol> with each event as <li>:
                <strong>[Event Name] — [City], [Country Code]</strong><br>
                Description: [2-3 concise sentences]<br>
                Location: [Venue/exact location]<br>
                Date: [DD/MM/YYYY]<br>
                Time: [HH:MM]<br>
                
                CONTEXT-AWARE LINKS:
                - If has_registrations: "✅ Registered" or "❌ Registration failed: [reason]"
                - <a href="[URL]">View Event Details on [Platform]</a> for all events

                4. CONTEXT-SPECIFIC SECTION:
                - If form_url exists: Include registration form section

                5. SIGNATURE:
